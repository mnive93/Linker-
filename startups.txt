Each acquisition is for the respective company in its entirety, unless otherwise specified. The acquisition date listed is the date of the agreement between Facebook and the subject of the acquisition. The value of each acquisition is listed in US dollars because Facebook's headquarters is in the United States. If the Facebook service that is derived from the acquired company is known, then it is also listed here.
Facebook has acquired 10 companies with its largest acquisition being the purchase of Instagram. It also purchased the defunct company ConnectU in a court settlement and acquired intellectual property formerly held by rival Friendster. The majority of the companies acquired by Facebook are based in the United States, and in turn, a large percentage of these companies are based in or around the San Francisco Bay Area. Facebook has also made investments in LuckyCal and Wildfire Interactive.
Most of Facebook's acquisitions have been 'talent acquisitions' and acquired products are often shut-down. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has stated that "We have not once bought a company for the company. We buy companies to get excellent people... In order to have a really entrepreneurial culture one of the key things is to make sure we're recruiting the best people. One of the ways to do this is to focus on acquiring great companies with great founders."[1] The Instagram acquisition, announced on 2012-04-09, appears to be the first exception to this pattern

Are you building the next Facebook or Google? Startup World is a global competition to find the next Jobs or Zuckerberg. The competition will be held in 20 cities world-wide, with the regional winners flying to Silicon Valley for a grand showdown to battle it out in front of a panel of expert judges to be crowned the world's best startup.
Much like competing on American Idol, selling a business idea requires raw talent, mastery of the material, and command performance. So this year we've launched Startup World — our global answer to the hit singing competition.
Whilst there's certainly advantages to building startups in Silicon Valley due to the sheer amount of entrepreneurs, venture capital and access to talent, startups and entrepreneurship is a global story.
Why are we doing this?
Silicon Valley is the highest producer of technology companies in the world, but as the cost of innovation comes down entrepreneurs all over the planet have the tools they need to get startups off the ground and reaching a global consumer base online. While most media is currently focusing on Silicon Valley, we want to shine a light on entrepreneurs in emerging markets.

Building a #startup takes smarts, capital and…hustle. Do you have it? More insights from 
4 more great speakers added to huge #startup conference @AndrewWarner @naithanjones @wilschroter
In the past few years, it seems like there’s been the explosion of startups trying to convince local businesses to sign up for their marketing or loyalty tools, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area. In fact, LocalOn co-founder Shahbano Imran recalled going door-to-door trying to convince businesses to sign up and discovering that “small businesses are getting pitched by 20 startups a day.”
her co-founder David Tolloupov came up with a better way to reach those businesses — working with local newspapers and merchants associations.
So instead of getting pitched by a random startup, businesses are offered a set of white labeled tools from a publication or an organization that they already trust. (The revenue is split between LocalOn and its resale partner.)
The approach seems to be working for the startup, which is part of incubator Y Combinator’s current class of companies. It has already partnered with 40 merchants associations and two newspapers in the Bay Area — apparently the partnership has generated $50,000 in new business for the East Bay Express newspaper over the past six months, and the OaklandGrown merchants association has seen a 20 percent increase in revenue from annual memberships.
So what is LocalOn asking these groups to sell? Well, Imran seemed particularly proud of its website builder, which is part of a wave of new services (such as Barley) designed to make it as easy as possible to build and edit a website. She gave me a quick demo of the LocalOn editor, which allows businesses to edit their site just as they would edit a presentation or document, with the changes going live immediately. It’s also easy to push new updates about events and deals to the site, which are automatically posted to social networks and local listings as well (that’s another way LocalOn’s partnerships come in handy). And there’s support for e-commerce.
LocalOn offers tools for merchants associations and newspapers too, including website hosting, a member directory, member billing, and a widget where real estate agents can submit listings for vacant properties — so the organizations are be both resellers and customers.
Imran told she plans to use LocalOn’s existing newspaper relationships to  beyond the Bay Area. Focusing on newspapers might not seem like a great strategy, given the industry’s decline, but Imran said alternative newsweeklies like the East Bay Express are in better health than people think. (And the newspapers can resell LocalOn tools to both individual businesses and to merchants associations.)
Looking ahead, Imran noted that there’s a growing number of interesting local products on the LocalOn platform, so the company could eventually work with its media partners to create interesting aggregated shopping experiences.

Now our OCD of sharing great knowledge with the Indian startup community has compelled us to publish this list of the top 10 bootstrapping Indian startups.
ACCELTRADE
Using proprietary trading algorithms and an indigenous platform for quantitative trading, Acceltrade is one of those tech startups that have chosen to focus on the finance sector. Its revenue generation model is quite unique too.
BROWSERSTACK
Based right across the street from the SutraHQ in Lokhandwala, BrowserStack offers innovative solutions for cross browser testing. It is fast catching up with the developer community worldwide. No mean feat, that too without any external funding.
FUSIONCHARTS
What started out as an initiative by a teenager to get some extra pocket money, FusionCharts now has more than 21,000 customers and 450,000 developers. Cofounder Pallav Nadhani could well be the poster boy for aspiring bootstrapping entrepreneurs.
GOOSEBUMP
Goosebump is an award-winning eCommerce site based in Mumbai that sells pickles online. Without any external funding, this bootstrapping Indian startup has made a name selling pickles to a populace that was brought up thinking only grandmothers makes it the best!
KAYAKO
Setup in 2001 by Varun Shoor with the aim of offering a better customer support experience, Kayako has come a long way. With a customer base of more than 30,000, this Indian startup successfully bootstrapped without external funding to become one of the leading developers of help desk and customer support software.
LOCALBANYA
Taking the concept of local ecommerce to a new level, LocalBanya went live in May 2012. Touted as Mumbai’s first online supermarket, LocalBanya has a huge catalog of grocery items and has a cult following amongst Mumbaikars.
MANGOSENSE
Mangosense is a Pune-based startup that has an innovative offering called as Mangoreader. One of those truly innovative Indian startups, their mission is to make books more fun for kids by making them very engaging.
MINDTICKLE
Setup by alumni from IITs, ISB and Stanford, MindTickle blends social tools and game mechanics to allow users to create interactive learning experience from their existing online training content.
SYNAGE
Starting as a design agency, Synage pivoted and become a web technology company in 2007. One of the first in India to launch a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) product, DeskAway, this Indian startup has received a lot of awards for their creations.
WINGIFY
Wingify is a bootstrapping Indian startup that is on a mission to develop world’s best technology in web analytics and optimization. And it seems they have already achieved that goal with their product – Visual Website Optimizer!
These Indian startups, a few of which have matured into profitable medium-sized businesses, exemplify the typical Indian entrepreneurship spirit of bootstrapping. While VCs and institutional funds are becoming easily accessible, most budding Indian startups and entrepreneurs can surely take a cue from these 10 businesses.

How to Formulate Strategy for a Start Up Organization?
their upbringing, you can learn a lot because they always sprinkle lessons of things they don’t do anymore, things that they do now, things you can relate to.”
Frasier pointed to the lyrics of Jay Z and P. Diddy, which he said could teach listeners about perseverance.
“He [Diddy] talks about work ethic, that’s something that a lot of people tend to overlook,” explained Frasier.
Even venture capitalists like Ben Horowitz, a Silicon Valley investor, use rap lyrics to teach business lessons, according to the New York Times. Every post on his popular blog begins with a hip-hop quote, meant to motivate readers.
Both Frasier and Horowitz firmly believe there are lessons to be learned in hip-hop lyrics;  lessons applicable to business. Here are 10 of the best startup lyric tips in rap:
“Don’t be worried about the next man – make sure your business tight.” (Dr. Dre, “Get Your Money Right”)
Focus on your product. When starting out, there may be several competitors in the space attempting to build similar services; try not to fixate on their progress. Concentrate on developing the best product, team and business plan you can.
 “I’d like for y’all to meet the love of my life, her name’s the game.” (Drake ft. Young Jeezy, “Unforgettable”)
Don’t expect to maintain a clear work-life divide, especially when first starting up. Your company is your brainchild, and as such will likely demand most of your time – especially if your office is also your front room.
 “Never mind what haters say, ignore them ’til they fade away.” (T.I. ft. Rihanna, “Live Your Life”)
Believe in your product. There will be plenty of naysayers, but fervent conviction in what you’re building will see you through – and convince investors to back you.

When it comes to technology start-ups, there are a lot of paths to success.
Some successful start-ups sell for a billion dollars, as Tumblr did this year to Yahoo. When that happens, it’s a windfall for the founders of the start-ups as well as for the investors and some employees.
Other new companies are considered successful if they attract millions of users and venture money before going public, as Facebook did and Twitter is doing. And still others are considered hot because their products attract demographic groups that advertisers want to reach or because they have come up with some new idea or technology that seems to change the way we live.
About a year ago, right after Instagram was snapped up by Facebook, a few other start-ups seemed poised for some degree of success. Some of them, like Pinterest, Square and Uber, are still thriving, with plenty of users and cash from investors. Others, like Path or Airtime, have lost steam, and users’ attention, and may be on their way to the tech boneyard.
This year, there’s a new class of interesting start-ups to watch. Some are attracting record numbers of new users and significant amounts of venture capital, or appealing to a new and interesting demographic. Some are simply working on a new idea that seems to be taking off. In the unpredictable world of tech start-ups, any of them could fizzle and be forgotten by the end of the year. But they could also be the next big thing.

Snapchat
This mobile application lets people send to their friends, family and crushes text messages and photos that self-destruct after a preset period of time. It sounds like something out of a spy movie, but Snapchat, which was released in late 2011, has caught on as a private messaging application among people who do not want to worry about unflattering photos or silly messages winding up online for others to see. The app is also a lightweight and entertaining way to communicate. Teenagers, in particular, seem to favor the service over traditional text messaging, e-mail and even Facebook messaging.
The company, which has not yet celebrated its second birthday, says it processes 200 million messages each day. That number represents a lot of users.
In June, Snapchat raised a $60 million round of venture financing that pushed the company’s valuation skyward of $800 million. If that seems high, consider that Onavo Insights, a mobile analytics firm, recently reported that Snapchat was used by nearly 20 percent of iPhone owners on a monthly basis, making it one of the most popular applications available on Apple’s mobile operating system.
WhatsApp
Paying for text messages is so 2012. As more of our daily interactions migrate to mobile, people are looking for cheap and easy ways to keep in touch, regardless of what device they are using or what country they live in.
WhatsApp is a messaging application that intends to replace the old-time system, known as SMS, and so far, seems to be doing just that. It costs $1 a year, and there is no advertising; it saves costs by forgoing any kind of archive for the messages.
Created by two former Yahoo engineers in 2009, the application is consistently ranked highly in various app stores. In early June, the company that makes it said it processed 27 billion messages in a single day.
With its focus on messaging, the company is clearly on to something: group messaging applications, like Beluga and GroupMe, have already been snapped up by Facebook and Skype, and Google and Apple have recently introduced their own versions of messaging applications.
Oculus VR
The Oculus Rift, a headset that looks like an oversize pair of ski goggles and that immerses the wearer in a virtual reality video game, started as a Kickstarter project to raise a quarter of a million dollars and ended up taking in more than $2 million. In June, the company raised another $16 million in venture financing from Spark Capital and others.
It recently began shipping the first versions of its virtual reality gaming machine to game developers and generated rave reviews at Electronic Entertainment Expo, the annual gaming convention, in June. The device’s technology is still in its early stages — the headset isn’t expected to be released commercially until 2014 — but it could unlock a new generation of gaming and entertainment experiences, one that goes beyond the last big thing in gaming, the gesture controls of the Kinect.
Wanelo

Shopping online replaced shopping at the mall long ago. But unless you know exactly what you are looking for, the abundance of places to shop online can be overwhelming. Wanelo — the name is a combination of want, need, love — offers on one site a collection of stylish goods, selected from shops around the Web. It’s Pinterest but with a business model. The site is one of the first to figure out how to make sense of the riotous selection of goods online and how to profit from them.
Founded in 2010, Wanelo not only has a good idea, it is popular among young women — a group that clothing companies are eager to reach. The site has more than 10 million users, and it recently closed an $11 million round of financing that would push the company’s valuation to $100 million. 
Lyft
Airbnb transformed the way people thought about the hotel industry by making it easy for people to rent out spare rooms in their homes to adventurous travelers. Ride-sharing services like Sidecar and Lyft hope to do the same for riders and drivers who are looking for ways to supplement public transportation or offer alternatives to expensive private car services like Uber. With the Lyft application, users can request a ride with a tap. Another Lyft user arrives shortly after and drives the passenger to the destination.
Lyft, which was founded in 2007 and is based in San Francisco, seems to have the most momentum of these services, recently landing an additional $60 million in financing, led by Andreessen Horowitz. The company also said it helped with 30,000 rides each week. Although Lyft’s availability is limited to a few cities, the company says it plans to spread across the country by the end of 2014. 
MYO
How will we interact with technology in the future — or to put this in tech speak, what will the interface of the future look like?
Apple and Google are experimenting with letting users control their phones and tablets with voice commands, while Microsoft Xbox is perfecting the 3-dimensional scanning software in the Kinect that lets players control video games by moving their arms and hands. But a start-up created in May 2012 in Waterloo, Canada, says its armband, which detects motions and muscle activity produced in the wearer’s arm and translates them to gestures on a 
screen, will be the real revolution in how we control our computers and other personal devices.
The company is working to develop ways to browse the Web, play games and interact in other ways online with the MYO armbands. It says it plans to start shipping to consumers in early 2014.
MYO is small — it was started by three engineers — but it has already raised close to $15 million from some notable venture capitalists and taken more than 30,000 preorders for its cutting-edge hardware.
Braintree
Online and mobile commerce is a muddled and crowded business, full of dozens of upstarts vying to be the next PayPal. But one company, Braintree, which provides the technology to process payments on the Web and on mobile devices, is quietly building an impressive list of clients — Rovio, Uber, OpenTable, Fab, Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Heroku and others — which give it a boost of credibility.
Braintree, based in Chicago, was started in 2007, but the company is picking up momentum. It recently acquired Venmo, an application that lets people pay each other through text message, and partnered with Simple, a banking start-up, to make mobile payments easier for people who use all three services.
The company says it processes $10 billion a year, a fraction of which is on mobile. It is a far cry from PayPal, which is on track to process $20 billion in mobile payments alone in 2013. But the Braintree raised a recent round of financing that brings its total venture cash pile to $70 millon, and it says it is just warming up.
King
Every so often, a new mobile game charms the masses and becomes the vice of millions around the world. Think of Draw Something, Angry Birds or Minecraft.
Often these games disappear as quickly as they appear. Candy Crush, though, the mobile game from a London gaming studio called King, seems to have a staying power that its predecessors lacked. Candy Crush, released for smartphones in late 2012, is the biggest hit to date for King, which has been around since 2003.
The game is simple enough: get three or more matching candies in a row. But it has 45 million players — more than Spotify, Pinterest and Zynga’s hits FarmVille 2 and Texas HoldEm Poker — and most of them are on mobile. According to the company, the game is played more than 600 million times each day on mobile devices.
Players can buy so-called boosters to help advance to higher levels. Analysts estimate that that these purchases could bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue each month, giving the company a nice enticement for investors in an initial public offering of stock, which many anticipate. There is no advertising in the game.

My answer to: What kinds of tech #startups are suitable to start in #Nepal (beside a web company)?
The startup ecosystem in India is thriving, especially with the rise in the number of angel investors and incubators. But what’s really turning out the be that feel-good story is the one about bootstrapping Indian startups who climbed up the success ladder without any external funding. At SutraLite, we have worked with many of these innovative startups, enabling them to ‘bootstrappingly’ recruit some really great candidates.
Now our OCD of sharing great knowledge with the Indian startup community has compelled us to publish this list of the top 10 bootstrapping Indian startups.
ACCELTRADE
Using proprietary trading algorithms and an indigenous platform for quantitative trading, Acceltrade is one of those tech startups that have chosen to focus on the finance sector. Its revenue generation model is quite unique too.
BROWSERSTACK
Based right across the street from the SutraHQ in Lokhandwala, BrowserStack offers innovative solutions for cross browser testing. It is fast catching up with the developer community worldwide. No mean feat, that too without any external funding.
FUSIONCHARTS
What started out as an initiative by a teenager to get some extra pocket money, FusionCharts now has more than 21,000 customers and 450,000 developers. Cofounder Pallav Nadhani could well be the poster boy for aspiring bootstrapping entrepreneurs.
GOOSEBUMP
Goosebump is an award-winning eCommerce site based in Mumbai that sells pickles online. Without any external funding, this bootstrapping Indian startup has made a name selling pickles to a populace that was brought up thinking only grandmothers makes it the best!
KAYAKO
Setup in 2001 by Varun Shoor with the aim of offering a better customer support experience, Kayako has come a long way. With a customer base of more than 30,000, this Indian startup successfully bootstrapped without external funding to become one of the leading developers of help desk and customer support software.
LOCALBANYA
Taking the concept of local ecommerce to a new level, LocalBanya went live in May 2012. Touted as Mumbai’s first online supermarket, LocalBanya has a huge catalog of grocery items and has a cult following amongst Mumbaikars.
MANGOSENSE
Mangosense is a Pune-based startup that has an innovative offering called as Mangoreader. One of those truly innovative Indian startups, their mission is to make books more fun for kids by making them very engaging.
MINDTICKLE
Setup by alumni from IITs, ISB and Stanford, MindTickle blends social tools and game mechanics to allow users to create interactive learning experience from their existing online training content.
SYNAGE
Starting as a design agency, Synage pivoted and become a web technology company in 2007. One of the first in India to launch a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) product, DeskAway, this Indian startup has received a lot of awards for their creations.
WINGIFY
Wingify is a bootstrapping Indian startup that is on a mission to develop world’s best technology in web analytics and optimization. And it seems they have already achieved that goal with their product – Visual Website Optimizer!
These Indian startups, a few of which have matured into profitable medium-sized businesses, exemplify the typical Indian entrepreneurship spirit of bootstrapping. While VCs and institutional funds are becoming easily accessible, most budding Indian startups and entrepreneurs can surely take a cue from these 10 businesses.
David Karp
Heard of Tumblr? There can’t be many people left on the planet who hasn’t. David started Tumblr with his own hard earned savings, without any investment in 2007.
It has been a long road to get to this point, but up until now Tumblr has still not been monetized. However, there are a number of well-known brands such as MTV set to sign up for Tumblr advertisements. In real terms though, David  Karp made millions instantly, as his net worth was in the millions as soon as Tumblr took off. Not bad for a 26 year old who started a home business from his own means.
Ben Lerer
While many of the tech entrepreneurs around are theoretical millionaires who have so far just had funding rather than actual revenue, this guy really is the real deal. Ben Lerer founded Thrillist, an amazingly simple concept that sounds like someone really should have thought of it earlier, but the very best ideas often do share this trait. It’s simply an online newsletter that allows advertisers to connect to people in a specific city. It has millions of subscribers, and plenty of companies willing to pay to reach them.
It initially earned $50k per annum, and took off almost instantly, netting Ben his first million within a month of trading.
Mark Zuckerberg
Okay, I know, his story has been done to death. There’s even a Hollywood movie about it. But you cannot make a list about people earning a million fast and not include Mark Zuckerberg. Especially since he’s now worth tens of billions of dollars, even after the disastrous Facebook IPO. As soon as Facebook started monetizing, mark made a million instantly.
As with many tech starts ups of this kind, Mark Zuckerberg was a millionaire the very moment he had a great idea and put it on the web.
Victor Kislyi
Although Victor’s company had been around for awhile before it developed it’s first commercial game, as soon as the game launched he became a millionaire. The game in question was Massive Assault for the PC.
In 2010 Victor Kislyi launched World of Tanks, which has gone on to be a huge success, making him a multi millionaire. He was so flush with cash, that he decided to fund a dig to excavate British RAF Spitfires that were buried during WW2.
Matthew Corrin
Matthew Corrin’s story is quite extraordinary, in that the hype he managed to create around his fresh produce was almost too much. When Matthew opened Freshii, a company that sells fresh, healthy fast food, he had queues around the block, and sold out of produce before lunch.
Within his first month of opening he was one healthy millionaire.
Ben Kaufman
Ben Kaufman launched Quirky when he was barely in his twenties, he couldn’t have imagined it would take off so quickly. His idea to get readers to vote on whether or not an upcoming product was a good idea was revolutionary. As with most millionaires of this type, as soon as his website went live he was instantly worth millions.
Markus Persson
The second games developer on our list, ‘Markus Persson‘ made the amazingly simple, but fiendishly addictive game Minecraft. Minecraft had a passionate following even before it’s official launch due to a very popular tech demo. As soon as it did, Marcus became an instant millionaire. He’s currently estimated to be worth around $15 million dollars.
Junaid Shams & Ahmed Khattak
These two are listed together because they shared the same brilliant idea. GSM Nation. With around $150,000 dollars of start-up capital, and some investment from Yale Entrepreneurial Institute, they came up with a way to offer their customers phones without getting locked down into a contract.
It made Junaid & Ahmed millions in revenue almost instantly.
