To protect the spines of books -- assuming you still have any -- bookmark them by leaving them open and hanging them off the edge of a desk or table. Never place books open, face-down, on a flat surface.
2
While waiting for a subway or train, look for the scuffed areas of the white or yellow line on the edge of the platform. This is where the doors are most likely to open.
3
If your hair tends to tangle, use a plastic hairbrush in the shower to brush in conditioner.

5

6
Cut the front panel off of pretty Christmas cards and use them as a no-crush alternative to bows for gift packages you're going to ship or take on an airplane. Make sure you don't give the card back to the person who sent it, though.
7
ceramic soup spoonUse Japanese ceramic soup spoons for soup and cereal. They're less likely to spill. Some are flat-bottomed or notched so they won't slip into a bowl.
8
Store shampoo bottles upside-down. (Nowadays some are designed that way.)
9

11

12
S CaribeanerGo to REI and get them to cut you a few 8-10 inch strips of brightly-colored rock climbing webbing: one ribbon per suitcase or piece of checked luggage that you use on trips. Not only does it help mark your luggage; but also, you can use the strips to tie wheeled luggage together in a daisy chain so you don't have to rent a cart. (While you're at it, buy a couple caribeaners for your backpack or rollaboard; they're handy for hooking your coat or water bottle.)
13
Diatomaceous Earth is non-toxic and has many household uses. Sprinkle it over fresh carpet stains, let it stand overnight and vacuum it up. On a recommendation from her carpet cleaning guy, my mom uses it on her white carpets to remove pet stains and odors, and I proved last Christmas that it will pick up spilled hot cocoa. It also kills ants, silverfish and fleas, but you have to sprinkle it everywhere and it takes several days. (Ants won't cross it, at least.) Concern Diatomaceous Earth is available at some nurseries and hardware stores as an eco-friendly bug killer.
14
Never pour old water down the sink: cat/food dishwater, ice cubes and water used to boil eggs can be used to water plants (let it cool first). Of course, don't reuse water that's had meat in it.
15
Put rice grains in saltshakers to absorb water and keep the salt from getting stuck in the holes.
16
Or put old rice in orphaned socks and tie them off. Microwave the sock for a minute to make a nice warm cuddly heating pad. (Frozen peas in a bag also work well as a cold pack for sinus headaches.)
17
Stretch a large rubber band over an open house paint can. When you pull the brush out, rub it against the rubber band to remove excess paint.
18
Solar powered led flashlight Get small solar-powered LED flashlights (I found mine at ACE hardware) and leave them in windowsills or on car dashboard. Then you will always have emergency flashlights charged up.
19
Put a bathmat or doormat in front of your front-end loaded washer and dryer, so wet clothes won't go sploot on the floor and pick up dirt.
20
One tablet of non-coated aspirin in a vase of water makes cut flowers last longer.
21
To help stay awake on a summer road trip, fill a paper cup with ice cubes at your roadside restaurant of choice and stick them in your hair / down your collar / under your hat from time to time.
22
Recycle printed office paper: cut paper into quarters, stack it, staple it or paint one edge with rubber cement to make note pads you leave near phones and computers. (Don't do this with confidential info.)
23
Mop shoesDoes your white kitchen tile or linoleum floor show dirt five seconds after you mopped it? Wear Microfiber Mop Shoes while in the kitchen -- just sprinkle some water (which you'll splash anyway when washing dishes) and wipe up dirt with your feet. Again, I got mine in Ace Hardware. Betcha they're in Target, too.
24
Get easy clip-on, removable panniers for your bike. Bike to the store. Remove the panniers and clip them to the inside of a grocery cart to make sure you don't buy too much to carry home!
25
Open an envelope you accidentally sealed: put in it the freezer for 2 hours, then slide a knife under the flap to open it. Freezing fabric is also a way to remove chewing gum (it can then be cracked off).
26
If you have a horrible time remembering PIN numbers, pick a special word or phrase like your birthdate, use the order of the letters as digits, and and then write down the PIN numbers using those letters. For example, April twelfth: A=1, P=2, R=3, I=4, L=5, T=6, W=7, E=8, L=5 (repeated letter), F=9, T=6 (repeated letter), H=0. If you found a piece of paper in someone's purse, would you guess that a note that reads "BLUE - TWLE" meant the PIN number for the blue ATM card was 6758? Just make sure you don't write down the code key!
27
Small soy sauce dishes on the kitchen counter make great spoon rests and teabag holders. (2-3 cups of tea per tea bag.)
28
Keep a book (what's that?) and a small folding camp stool in the car in case you get somewhere that requires you to stand in line.
29
Oven rack hookBuy or or make a wooden oven rack hook to pull out and push in metal racks so you don't burn your hands trying to reach in and grab a pot between hot shelves.
30
On your refrigerator, post a noticeable piece of paper with the phone numbers of your neighbors, an emergency contact number, and instructions/directions to the nearest emergency room. If someone has to call 911 for you, you want them to know which hospital to take you to! You can print it out on your computer so it looks a little less ugly, or put it on the side of the fridge, but you want people to see

There are numerous life hacks you can use to overcome the mental blocks that stop your life. Almost all of us do various things to keep moving on, to show the world we have something to do, but in the end we only find ourselves blocked. Changing your Facebook statuses, taking inspiration from the movies, cleaning our computers, washing our clothes, making attempts to become an online sensation, rationalizing the steps we take to change our lives, eating heavy meals, hyper socializing and every other thing we do are just mere attempts to make sense out of our lives.

Everyone in the world loves to be admired, especially the one who say they don’t care at all. But there come times, when people start to think that nobody likes them. So, keeping in view these facts about life, I will try to add some useful tips into the article.

But here I would be jotting down some of the most useful and amazing life hacks that will help you in overcoming all your mental blocks and in changing your life for good. Here the 10 amazing life hacks you should use to change yourself.

10. Flattery

For those of you who are facing a number of problems at your workplace, the use of flattery can prove to be handy for you. It is known to be one of the top most self-promotion strategies known to man. But it is imperative here to make it appear like flattery, as the opposite might pose a great deal of harm on you.








9. Improvising

The idea here is to improvise at the time when you find a person tired. It is fact that when you plan to impress someone you like or plan to get into touch with that person, then it is best to improvise at the time when you find the person tired. But here, you would need to ask for a help of low intensity, otherwise he or she might turn down some large requests from your side. On asking for help at that specific instant, most of the people would agree to provide help the next day.








8. Call Others by Their Name

Dale Carnegie has suggested this strategy in his famous book, How to win Friends. In it, he has suggested that the best way to impress someone for the first time is by making use of the person’s name. No matter in what language you might call out his or her name, they are sure to be impressed no matter what. The name of a person is the core and most integral part of his or her identity. Moreover, try to speak out the name in a respectful manner and do not pose yourself as a disrespectful moron.








7. Do not correct others

In the same book, Carnegie had specified that in order to influence another person, try to listen to him or her as much as possible and never try to correct the person. No matter the person is right or wrong, always show your interest in listening to the person, as who knows you might be able to bag yet another admirer through the use of this maneuver.








6. Winning Arguments

At the time you find yourself in an argument with someone who has more knowledge about an issue about which you are not equipped, try to laugh out the argument. Trust me when I say that this strategy indeed comes in handy and will save you the embarrassment of being termed an ignorant and a person with limited knowledge. Moreover, this life hack does come in handy in gaining the upper hand in any trivial argument. On seeing you laugh, the other person will turn mad and will start losing his grasp on the propositions and statements he or she would be making. Try it out, as it won’t hurt you. But even still if you think that you are on the verge of losing the argument, try to use the sentence “Yeah, yeah, yeah, but still you are not making sense, stop mumbling and give me sound logic”.








5. Making Others like You

When you want to impress someone, but are held back by the belief that the person doesn’t likes you, it best to ask for favors. For example, to begin with you can ask the person for a pencil or something else. Surely, this psychological trick is really cool in making others like you a bit more. At the same time, you can also ask the person for another small favor, which you think he or she won’t be able to turn down. Moreover, while talking to a person you want to impress, it is always best to be funny, but remember to make no stupid jokes. At the same time, you should also bear in mind that most of the people in this world are only interested in themselves. Try and talk about themselves, ensure that the conversation remains focused on them and make them believe that they are the only ones in charge. Try asking him or her questions related to their “self” like their hobbies, interests, how they spend their vacations, what are the things they hate etc. The most important thing here is to keep your eyes fixed on them most of the times while the conversation progresses.








4. Changing the Channel of your Life

The one common reason for which most of us find ourselves being blocked by the dead ends, is all because we place our attention and cognitive abilities in things we do not actually want. The idea here is to keep our mind focused on the initial aim with which we set out. To begin with, you should try to do something that is completely unlinked to the problem. The previous-you would have gave in the problems and mental blocks. In order to pass your time, you might love to spin on a chair in order see that how many spins you can make in a single go, but this is all nonsense, to say the least. Instead, you can open a nice YouTube link for listening to an amazing song. As they say, in order to find a solution to a problem, it is best to go outside the problem and then try to look what is happening on the inside.








3. Modify your Environment

Now here is the life hack that is really the most recommended in order to overcome or to walk past the mental blocks that come your way. The one thing that is really weird about our brain is the fact that it functions like a pattern making machine, as it is its job. All of these patterns are formed on the basis of the thoughts and actions we have in mind. Most of the times, the mental blocks that come out way are resulted when we find ourselves stuck in some bizarre brain pattern, which finally changes into a routine if not dealt. But not to panic here, as by changing your environment, you would be able to look what lies beyond the wall that is blocking you. The idea here is to make use of something that would come to disrupt the same old sluggish daily routine. In short, this strategy would turn out to be an effective measure for broadening and notching the way we make patterns in our life.








2. Asking for Help

Even after making use of the above mentioned maneuvers, you still find yourself being strangled and muffled by the dead ends in your life, what else could be more utilitarian than seeking some help for a person you know and trust. There is no single person on this planet who can claim that he or she strode towards glory and achievement all alone. At the same time those who do link their success to their own persona, are nothing more than just selfish pricks having no regard for the people who matter in their lives. Furthermore, you can ask for some help from a person you think is experienced in terms of tackling similar situations. Surely, there is some reason for which most of the opinions in the world are available to us for free. So, why not make use of these free opinions and say (F off) to all our problems in life.








1. Talk Positive, Think Positive and Be Positive

Never allow yourself to think negative about life. Although there come times when everything around us seems to be marked with profound negativity, but trust me in say that these things have been designed to test our limits. People hate being sad more than they love to be happy and remember that there is a difference between the two. When you are meeting someone for the first time or going for a date, then try to avoid the danger topics as much as possible like religion, politics, economy and many more. Even if you plan to talk about something bad that happened to you, try add some fun into it. In other words, you need to show the other person that you are not among those faint hearted people who are turned down by the problems in life. But first you need to figure out the exact kind of humor you are good at. Some people happen to be great at physical comedy, while others rely on the usage of their dry sense of humor based on puns and mere cynicism. Even if you make a joke that doesn’t turn out to be funny, try to bounce back from it and make another one. The best thing here is the fact that people never remember the jokes that weren’t funny, they only remember the ones that were. There is always a second chance for everything in life, but the outcome would be judged on the basis what you make out of it. Be happy, keep rolling-that is what life is all about, isn’t it?  So, now might be the right time to make use of the 6 amazing life hacks to transform and change your life.

Almost all of us do various things to keep moving on, to show the world we have something to do, but in the end we only find ourselves blocked. Changing your Facebook statuses, taking inspiration from the movies, cleaning our computers, washing our clothes, making attempts to become an online sensation, rationalizing the steps we take to change our lives, eating heavy meals, hyper socializing and every other thing we do are just mere attempts to make sense out of our lives.

Everyone in the world loves to be admired, especially the one who say they don’t care at all. But there come times, when people start to think that nobody likes them. So, keeping in view these facts about life, I will try to add some useful tips into the article.

But here I would be jotting down some of the most useful and amazing life hacks that will help you in overcoming all your mental blocks and in changing your life for good. Here the 10 amazing life hacks you should use to change yourself.

10. Flattery

For those of you who are facing a number of problems at your workplace, the use of flattery can prove to be handy for you. It is known to be one of the top most self-promotion strategies known to man. But it is imperative here to make it appear like flattery, as the opposite might pose a great deal of harm on you.








9. Improvising

The idea here is to improvise at the time when you find a person tired. It is fact that when you plan to impress someone you like or plan to get into touch with that person, then it is best to improvise at the time when you find the person tired. But here, you would need to ask for a help of low intensity, otherwise he or she might turn down some large requests from your side. On asking for help at that specific instant, most of the people would agree to provide help the next day.








8. Call Others by Their Name

Dale Carnegie has suggested this strategy in his famous book, How to win Friends. In it, he has suggested that the best way to impress someone for the first time is by making use of the person’s name. No matter in what language you might call out his or her name, they are sure to be impressed no matter what. The name of a person is the core and most integral part of his or her identity. Moreover, try to speak out the name in a respectful manner and do not pose yourself as a disrespectful moron.








7. Do not correct others

In the same book, Carnegie had specified that in order to influence another person, try to listen to him or her as much as possible and never try to correct the person. No matter the person is right or wrong, always show your interest in listening to the person, as who knows you might be able to bag yet another admirer through the use of this maneuver.








6. Winning Arguments

At the time you find yourself in an argument with someone who has more knowledge about an issue about which you are not equipped, try to laugh out the argument. Trust me when I say that this strategy indeed comes in handy and will save you the embarrassment of being termed an ignorant and a person with limited knowledge. Moreover, this life hack does come in handy in gaining the upper hand in any trivial argument. On seeing you laugh, the other person will turn mad and will start losing his grasp on the propositions and statements he or she would be making. Try it out, as it won’t hurt you. But even still if you think that you are on the verge of losing the argument, try to use the sentence “Yeah, yeah, yeah, but still you are not making sense, stop mumbling and give me sound logic”.








5. Making Others like You

When you want to impress someone, but are held back by the belief that the person doesn’t likes you, it best to ask for favors. For example, to begin with you can ask the person for a pencil or something else. Surely, this psychological trick is really cool in making others like you a bit more. At the same time, you can also ask the person for another small favor, which you think he or she won’t be able to turn down. Moreover, while talking to a person you want to impress, it is always best to be funny, but remember to make no stupid jokes. At the same time, you should also bear in mind that most of the people in this world are only interested in themselves. Try and talk about themselves, ensure that the conversation remains focused on them and make them believe that they are the only ones in charge. Try asking him or her questions related to their “self” like their hobbies, interests, how they spend their vacations, what are the things they hate etc. The most important thing here is to keep your eyes fixed on them most of the times while the conversation progresses.








4. Changing the Channel of your Life

The one common reason for which most of us find ourselves being blocked by the dead ends, is all because we place our attention and cognitive abilities in things we do not actually want. The idea here is to keep our mind focused on the initial aim with which we set out. To begin with, you should try to do something that is completely unlinked to the problem. The previous-you would have gave in the problems and mental blocks. In order to pass your time, you might love to spin on a chair in order see that how many spins you can make in a single go, but this is all nonsense, to say the least. Instead, you can open a nice YouTube link for listening to an amazing song. As they say, in order to find a solution to a problem, it is best to go outside the problem and then try to look what is happening on the inside.








3. Modify your Environment

Now here is the life hack that is really the most recommended in order to overcome or to walk past the mental blocks that come your way. The one thing that is really weird about our brain is the fact that it functions like a pattern making machine, as it is its job. All of these patterns are formed on the basis of the thoughts and actions we have in mind. Most of the times, the mental blocks that come out way are resulted when we find ourselves stuck in some bizarre brain pattern, which finally changes into a routine if not dealt. But not to panic here, as by changing your environment, you would be able to look what lies beyond the wall that is blocking you. The idea here is to make use of something that would come to disrupt the same old sluggish daily routine. In short, this strategy would turn out to be an effective measure for broadening and notching the way we make patterns in our life.








2. Asking for Help

Even after making use of the above mentioned maneuvers, you still find yourself being strangled and muffled by the dead ends in your life, what else could be more utilitarian than seeking some help for a person you know and trust. There is no single person on this planet who can claim that he or she strode towards glory and achievement all alone. At the same time those who do link their success to their own persona, are nothing more than just selfish pricks having no regard for the people who matter in their lives. Furthermore, you can ask for some help from a person you think is experienced in terms of tackling similar situations. Surely, there is some reason for which most of the opinions in the world are available to us for free. So, why not make use of these free opinions and say (F off) to all our problems in life.








1. Talk Positive, Think Positive and Be Positive

Never allow yourself to think negative about life. Although there come times when everything around us seems to be marked with profound negativity, but trust me in say that these things have been designed to test our limits.

Although there come times when everything around us seems to be marked with profound negativity, but trust me in say that these things have been designed to test our limits. People hate being sad more than they love to be happy and remember that there is a difference between the two. When you are meeting someone for the first time or going for a date, then try to avoid the danger topics as much as possible like religion, politics, economy and many more. Even if you plan to talk about something bad that happened to you, try add some fun into it. In other words, you need to show the other person that you are not among those faint hearted people who are turned down by the problems in life. But first you need to figure out the exact kind of humor you are good at. Some people happen to be great at physical comedy, while others rely on the usage of their dry sense of humor based on puns and mere cynicism. Even if you make a joke that doesn’t turn out to be funny, try to bounce back from it and make another one. The best thing here is the fact that people never remember the jokes that weren’t funny, they only remember the ones that were. There is always a second chance for everything in life, but the outcome would be judged on the basis what you make out of it. Be happy, keep rolling-that is what life is all about, isn’t it?  So, now might be the right time to make use of the 6 amazing life hacks to transform and change your life.

1. Dress the part
Your appearance is the thing people see first. They look at your clothes, hair, shoes, etc. They make assumptions about you before you even open your mouth. If you want to impress people, dress for the occasion. Take time to get ready in the morning.

2. Be on time
If you’re late for something, you’re giving someone the opportunity to judge you without you even being there. If you say you’re going to be somewhere at a certain time, then be there at that time. Waiting for someone when they should already be there is frustrating and annoying.

3. Don’t break your promises
There are too many people out there making promises they know they can’t keep. They promise something because it makes the other person feel better in that moment. The problem with that is that down the road, when you don’t follow through, the comfort that person felt turns into discouragement, frustration and even anger. If you can’t keep a promise, don’t make it. If you do make a promise, do everything you can to keep it.

4. Respect others
This includes your elders, minors, co-workers, family members, etc. This can be hard when you have to be around someone who has differing opinions than you, or who acts in a way you don’t approve of. But you can still be civil. If you look for attributes you respect in people, you will find them.

5. Be involved
If you support going green, then go green in your life. If you support your local government, then attend community meetings. Be a part of the things that matter to you.

6. Say, “Please,” and, “Thank you,” often
These are small words, but they go a long way. Expressing your gratitude to people, even for the smallest acts of kindness, shows that you see the good in people; it shows that you pay attention to the things people around you are doing and saying.

7. Smile often
Smiles are contagious. If a stranger walks past you at the store and smiles, it is a natural response to smile back. Seeing someone smile can remind others that there are things to be grateful for, that life is fun and exciting.

8. Don’t be constantly using your phone
When you are with someone, be with them. Phones are an amazing piece of technology. But they are also a distraction. Use your phone when it’s appropriate. You don’t need it out every second of every day.

9. Be faithful to your partner
We hear story after story about divorces and infidelity. It’s everywhere. By being honest and true with your partner, you are showing that you know where your priorities are. You understand what it means to be in a healthy relationship.

10. Support your children
Take time to be involved in your kids’ lives. Know what they’re interested in. Go their games, recitals, competitions, parent-teacher conferences, etc. Listen when they talk to you. Be the kind of parent they know they can go to when they have questions.

11. Personal hygiene isn’t an option, it’s a requirement
Have breath mints handy. Wear deodorant. Brush your teeth. Wear clean clothes. These are things that should be common sense, but some people really struggle with them. Talking to someone with bad breath is gross. It’s distracting. All you can think about is that you want to give them a mint. Take care of your personal hygiene and people will be more focused on what you’re saying and doing instead of how you smell.

12. Speak clearly and make eye contact
Let the person you’re talking to know that you are engaged in the conversation and that you care about what you’re discussing. Don’t mumble or look around, keep your focus on them.

13. Don’t chew gum
This can depend on the type of situation you’re in. If you’re with family hanging out or with close friends at the movies, gum is fine. But in a professional situation, gum is distracting.

14. Use humor
This can lighten the mood and bring people down from a tense state. Just make sure you’re using this at appropriate times.

15. Greet people with a handshake or hug
Determine what type of situation you’re in. You probably don’t want to go in to an interview and hug your potential boss, but you should offer them a firm handshake. With close friends and family members a hug shows a level of intimacy. It shows that you love and care about them and gives you a way to physically express that.

16. Be true to yourself
Know what you want out of life and do everything you can to achieve it.

17. Listen to others
When someone is talking to you, listen to what they are saying. Don’t be thinking of a response while they are still talking.

18. Perform acts of kindness
Open the door for someone, collect your neighbor’s mail when they go out town, make dinner for someone who just had a baby.

19. Be organized
Have a schedule and know what you have going on. Know where things are in your house, at work, in your car, etc.

20. Compliment people
Look for the good in people around you and take the time to let them know you noticed. Compliment them on their clothes, their work, their attitude, anything you can think of.

21. Share knowledge and information with others
When you have a skill or talent, share it. Teach others and share what you know and have learned.

22. Be positive and focus on the good
This can be hard when times are tough, but it’s possible. Look for the solution instead of focusing on the problem. Stay positive.

23. Help others
Help when and where you can. In most cases, chances to serve aren’t always at the most opportune times, but sacrificing your time to help someone in need says a lot about you.

24. Keep a clean car
Take your car through the car wash every so often. Clean out the inside. Don’t let garbage pile up. You never know when you’re going to have to give someone a ride.

25. Care about people
Don’t build up a wall to “protect” your feelings. Let yourself feel, let yourself care for people.

26. Don’t take offense
Things will be said and people will do things, purposefully or accidentally, that could hurt you. You can choose to be offended or to move past it.

27. Own up to your mistakes
When you make a mistake, admit it, own up to it, do what you can to fix it and move on.

28. Take advantage of experiences life has to offer
If you get the opportunity to go somewhere new, learn a new talent or try something new, do it! Enjoy life.

29. Know what’s going on in the world
Be up to date on recent news, both local and global. Be informed.

30.  Travel
The world is a big place. Take the time to go out and meet new people, learn new cultures and make new memories.
1. Don’t catastrophize
Stop thinking about the worst-case scenario, and all the things that could possibly go wrong. Instead, step back and take a realistic look at life. Nothing is ever the end of the world, after all.

2. Stop ruminating
A lot of bad moods are worsened by the fact that you keep thinking about them, and feeling sorry for yourself. Stop being so concerned with how you feel. You’ll never change things by getting stuck in thinking about them – take action instead, to make things better.

3. Get perspective
If you think your depression has been fueled by a specific event, make sure you’re not blowing things out of proportion. A chat with a caring friend may help you to see your way through the fog.

4. Focus on the positives
Realize that your mood may be magnifying the bad things in life, and you may find yourself focusing on the negative. Instead, look for what’s good in a situation, even if it’s just a lesson or a chance to grow stronger.

5. Don’t over-analyze
Running through exactly what has gone wrong, and picking it to pieces, rarely helps. Instead of endlessly going over the problem, and getting bogged down in the details, start thinking about possible solutions.

6. Be kind to yourself
When people feel bad, they sometimes talk to themselves unkindly, and beat themselves up. What you need right now is a friend, not an enemy. Make sure your words and deeds are gentle and encouraging.

7. Don’t dwell on the past
It’s totally pointless to worry about the past, because you can’t change it. The best thing about the past is that it’s over. Allow yourself to move on.

8. Don’t fret about the future
The only power you have to change things is in the present moment, so it’s a waste of time worrying about the future, especially as you have no idea how things may turn out. Instead, take positive steps now, so you can handle whatever life throws at you.

9. Avoid black-and-white thinking
If something has gone wrong, or you made one mistake, it doesn’t mean that your whole life is doomed, or that you’re no good. Cut yourself slack and consider a more balanced version of events.

10. Fake it a bit
Science shows that even if you’re not happy, putting on a smile releases feel-good chemicals in your brain. If the mental trick of slapping on a big grin seems a bit much, then try a half-smile instead to lift your mood.

11. Stop being a victim
When you’re feeling low, it’s easy to get caught up in believing that bad things are happening because of you. Don’t allow yourself to believe that you’re a victim. You have the power to choose how you react to problems – and that’s the most powerful thing of all.

12. Get moving
It’s virtually impossible to hang onto a horrible mood when you’re jogging on the spot, or jumping on a trampoline, because your physiology won’t allow it. Try moving your body and see if that will brighten your mood.

13. Don’t isolate
You may be especially sensitive to what other people say and do if you’re feeling down, but remember that shutting yourself away will only make you feel worse. Meeting a friend for a quick coffee, or getting fresh air, can only help your frame of mind.

14. Reach out to others
Helping other people is a wonderful way of taking the focus off yourself and how you are feeling. Helping others feels good as well, so it’s a great mental trick to lift your mood.

15. Be grateful
It’s very difficult to be depressed if you can write a long list of all the things you love in your life. Not so much a mental trick, as a realization of what you’re very lucky to have, despite this tough time you’re going through.


1. Be Present
Don’t always think about what tomorrow is going to bring or what happened yesterday. Today is a brand new day, a clean slate. For every activity that you participate in, be 100% there instead thinking about what else is on your to-do list. When you are mindful and completely present, age does not even enter into the equation.

2. Listen First
Have you ever met a person who always interjects in a conversation and never listens to your thoughts? Rude! Well, learn from them and decide that you will not do that to anyone else. Listen to what others have to say and think before you respond. When you do this, you will notice that you begin to truly care about what the other person is saying and you will find that wisdom can be beyond age if you will just listen. You may learn something from someone younger than you, which will make you feel younger than your peers.

3. Daily Entertainment
Choose what you read and watch on the TV carefully. The more you read the news and other information sources that are full of negativity, the more that you will begin to see life that way. When you open up to continually reading positive new things and watching things that interest you and are a good influence, you will not see age in the same light. You will feel much younger and realize that your age is just a number and is not a constraint on you.

4. Are You More Experienced?
We all know a person who believes they know everything, and someone who is the exact opposite who always feels inferior to others. Age can play with our minds, tricking us into believing either that we know everything or we are too old to know anything. We are never to old to learn something new and open to up to sharing with others. Knowledge is a gift, and once you share it we can all learn. Let go of saying you are too experienced or do not know enough, and explore the possibilities. Age will not be an issue then.

5. Surround Yourself With Younger People
When you are around younger generations, you will always learn something and be caught up with what is happening in their world. Younger people will look to you for advice and wisdom. Are you having trouble finding someone to talk to? Just walk into your local coffee shop and strike up a conversation. This will make you feel younger and being around younger people will bring out the best in you. You will stop going on about how old you are!

6. Eat Real Food and Exercise
When you eat a whole food diet that does not include processed foods and you get adequate exercise, it is proven that you will not only feel younger but can do things that you might not have believed were possible. Take Fauja Singh for instance, who ran his last marathon at the young age of 101. When you fuel your body properly and move naturally, you can do anything, and physically you’ll be a lot younger than your chronological age.

7. Sleep
You know that sleep is important, but do you know how important? Sleep allows our bodies time to for leptin activation and optimal hormone output. In layman’s terms, sleep keeps us healthy. Without a sound night’s rest, you will start to see yourself aging faster, along with developing associated health issues. Turn off the lights and get to bed earlier.

8. Do Something New
Getting into a routine and good habits is easy. When you start adding something new and different into your day, you begin to take on a different perspective. You may even find a new hobby or sideline that you really love. You are no longer focused on age being an issue if you truly enjoy what you are doing.

9. Stay Positive
Attitude is one of the main keys in life. The more optimistic and positive you are, the more you will see the joys in life. You will continue to look at the opportunities and not focus on the negative aspects.

10. Stress Less
Stressors are everywhere in our environment, but it’s all in how you eliminate them that helps you stay young. Start being mindful and focus on what you can do right now instead of tomorrow. Turn off the news and focus on what is happening with you and those closest to you. When you see the good in life, the stressors that once were there are eliminated. Alongside this, clearing your mind before bed is another way to turn off all of the stress. Try the Navy Seals method by box breathing.

Time is construed in our minds and is only a perspective. When we make this our reality and say that we cannot do something solely because of a number, we limit ourselves. But nothing could be further from the truth. I know many people who spend their time being mindful and present today and age is the last thing on their mind. They realize that today is what matters and the impossible is possible if you just try. Don’t let your age be a roadblock—look to Fauja Singh for inspiration.
