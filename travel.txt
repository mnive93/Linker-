Sure there's a certain beauty in seeing the intense blue of the water in this famous sea cave, but to see it you have to take an expensive motorboat and then a rowboat across the island. Not only is it an overpriced logistical hassle, it's not worth going to Capri just to see it -- it's often inaccessible due to weather conditions.
